Introduction on modular arithmetic:
xmodN means find the remainder of x when divided by N.  
two integers a and b are said to be in the same equivalence class or congruent modulo N 
if they hav ethe same remainder upon division by N.  
a congruent to b mod n is
This should be not an equal sign but instead three parallel horizontal lines
a=b(modn)
This creates equivalence classes, but more on that later

The first property is to notice that it is the remainder. 
That is 444mod11 has a remainder of 4,  so we can say 444=4(mod11)
So a is being divided by 11 and b is the remainder is one way to think of this.
